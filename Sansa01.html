	<p>This is my dog Sansa, we have had her for at least 10 years. The timeline gets fuzzy before that. Sansa is the <b>best</b> dog in the entire world.</p>
	<h3><i>Why</i> Sansa is the Best Dog Ever:</h3>

	<ul><li><p>Sansa <i>loves</i> to sleep, but even when she's wide awake she snores so loudly.</p></li></ul>
	<ul><li><p>Sansa is a rescue, when she was just a puppy someone tied her to a porch and abandoned her. Despite such deglect, she remained sweet and loves so fiercely.</p></li></ul>
	<ul><li><p>Sansa is always watching out for the people she loves, as seen in the picture below.</p></li></ul>
